Replica Set

Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set

DaemonSets can improve the performance of a Kubernetes cluster by distributing maintenance tasks and support services via deploying Pods across all nodes. They are well suited for long-running services like monitoring or log collection. Following are some example use cases of DaemonSets:

1.To run a daemon for cluster storage on each node, such as glusterd and ceph.
2. To run a daemon for logs collection on each node, such as Fluentd and logstash.
3. To run a daemon for node monitoring on every note, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, collectd, or Datadog agent.
